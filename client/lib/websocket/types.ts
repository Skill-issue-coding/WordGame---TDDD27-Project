/**
 * @file types.ts (lib/websocket)
 * Master WebSocket type composition.
 *
 * Imports per-domain event unions and merges them into the top-level
 * WSReceivedEvent and WSSendPayloadMap consumed by WebSocketProvider,
 * subscribe(), and sendEvent().
 *
 * Domain breakdown:
 *   lobby.ts         — connection handshake, lobby management, chat
 *   game/impostor.ts — Impostor mode server → client events (including canonical
 *                      lifecycle events game_round_started / new_game_phase / game_result
 *                      with Impostor-specific payload shapes)
 *   game/shared.ts   — client → server input actions (game_submit_word, etc.)
 *
 * Adding a new game mode: create game/<mode>.ts, define its WSReceivedEvent
 * union (reusing the canonical event names with mode-specific payloads), and
 * add it to the WSReceivedEvent union below.
